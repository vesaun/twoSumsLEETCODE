My amateur approach to Leetcode's Two Sum problem.
This is my approach to Leetcode's problem : Two sums.
As of now, I used brute force with time complexity O(n^2) since I do not have the knowledge to use hash maps.
If anyone would like, please add onto this to show me how to optimize this solution!
